## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

I got more comfortable with responsive design and using media queries. There's still a lot I need to practice, but this project helped me understand the basics better.

### Continued development

I plan to revisit this project later to clean up the code and improve how it looks on smaller screens.
